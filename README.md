🎓 **Cybersecurity student** with a love for all things electric and a curiosity for what makes technology tick—from the code level up to the hardware.

## 📖 Some facts about me
- Not too long ago worked for 2 projects 
with an user base over 2000 people, I made for them automatically manual spoofers, colorbots/ai with accurate aim logic(software/hardware)
- Also pasted some cheats for games with low-tier AC just for fun

## 🛠️ Skills
- Because I'm still studying don't expect from me a big skills XD
- **C++**: For building fast, efficient, and low-level applications
- **Python**: For automating, scripting, and rapid prototyping
- **Verilog (a bit!)**: Exploring the world of hardware design

## 🚀 Favorite Project
- **Ulffrisk pcileech**: Delving into hardware hacking and DMA attacks—because exploring the boundaries of what’s possible is where the fun begins.

## ⚡ Interests
- Anything connected to **electricity** or **radio engineering**: If it’s buzzing, transmitting, or lighting up, I’m interested!
- **Motorcycles**: When I’m not at my pc, you might find me riding into the sunset.
